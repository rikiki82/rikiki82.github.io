      <h2>What's this website's about?</h2>
      <p>I'm Nicolas, 21 and I always gave a great importance to food. I've always loved eating but especially cooking and sharing good 
      food. <br/>So I created this website to share the favorite recipes and maybe bring you some tasty happiness at home during this hard time 
      of health crisis.<br/>Here's a selection of my favorite meals, the ones I recommend the most, either because they are delicious or they 
      can be very easy and quick dishes.</p>
      <p>The first one on the list is carbonara pasta, the absolute best! It's been my favorite dish since I'm a child and I love it even more 
         since I'm cooking my own food and it's such an easy dish to make. It's a 10 to 15 minutes preparation depending on your pasta cooking 
         time. It's also a great dish because there are so many variations like the old Italian one where there's no crème fraîche but only egg, 
         pecorino and parmesan cheese.<br/>But I decided to share you the recipe of my mom's wich is the best in my opinion. No I'm not biased 
         at all!</p>

      <p>Then on my list is my favorite dessert/snack, cookies. It's so easy to make, you just have to follow the recipe, there is no need to 
         watch over them when they're cooking, NO ONE can mess it up. It's really fast to make them, 15 minutes for the dough, 10 to shape them 
         and 10 min in the oven! It's also really cheap and there are an infinity of variations, I even tried with cheese in it. Spoiler! It 
         wasn't that great. My favorite ones so far are peanut butter and nutella, caramel and nutella and white chocolate cookies.</p>
      <div class="photo2"></div>
      <p>In 3rd position the healthy and not fat nor salted fondue! It's a very good meal, especially to share with friends and family. It's 
         uselly prepared during winter because it's a really warm and invigorating dish and you wouldn't want to spoil that beautiful body of 
         yours.<br/>But I could eat it anytime as it's so good the only downside is that you either need to go to a restaurant that make fondues 
         or buy a fondue device and ask your cheesemonger to prepare you the assortment of cheese.<br/>Anyway, it's a great choice of meal to 
         share with several people and it's even often appreciated by people that don't really like cheese.</p>
